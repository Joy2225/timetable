# ASEB Timetable

This is an Android app that shows your college timetable as a widget on your home screen. The aim is to allow any student of Amrita School of Computing/AI/Engineering to install the app and immediately get up and running with their timetable already in the app.

## Installation

1. Join the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/aseb-timetable).
2. [Download the app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=town.amrita.timetable) from the Play Store.
3. For feedback and updates, join the [WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/Grt1OenGQna40QhKFxYz3n?mode=r_t). APK releases can also be found here.

## I don't see my timetable!

Currently, timetables are crowdsourced, so the app doesn't have all of them. Not to worry though, since you can contribute yours and make it available to everybody. Make a pull request to the [timetable-registry](https://github.com/amritadottown/timetable-registry) repo to add yours as a JSON file. For more guidance, [WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/Grt1OenGQna40QhKFxYz3n?mode=r_t).
